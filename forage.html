            <h1 class="title">Rosebay willowherb </h1>
            <p class="text">Chamaenerion angustifolium is a perennial herbaceous flowering plant in the willowherb family Onagraceae. In the Springtime the young shoots and leaves can be eaten raw, and as they get older need to be steamed or boiled for 10 minutes. Treat the shoots like asparagus.The root can be cooked as a vegetable, added to stews.If you split the stem you can scrape out the sweet pith as a cucumber-like snack, though this can be quite astringent.The flower stalks when in bud can be snacked upon raw and added to soups for flavour. 
            Peel the roots, gently pound them and use as a poultice for skin damage such as burns, sores, swellings, boils and other similar hindrances.
            The leaves as a tea act as a tonic for the whole system, helping digestion and inflammation, but don’t drink too much because they’re also a laxative (unless you need loosening).
